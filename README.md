VisDock Libraries

VisDock is an interactive web-visualization framework written in JavaScript. VisDock allows visualization
creators to import various VisDock tools into their host visuailzations for exploration and annotation
purposes.

Say you have built a visualization like the one shown above (<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269">original work</a> by M. Bostock).

VisDock Toolkit and the Overview can be loaded with only two lines of codes (to learn more go to <a href="https://github.com/VisDockHub/NewVisDock/blob/master/Tutorial.md">Tutorial</a>).

VisDock Toolkit offers various navigation options. In the figures above, pan, zoom, rotation tools, and magnifying lenses (the box with grey-stroke) have been showcased. Up to this point, no coding effort is required at all. All you have to do is just to import VisDock libraries and initialize the VisDock. Beyond this point where selection and annotations are used, minor additional coding will be required.

In order to implement selections, the user-defined selection handler must be added to your original code. In this selection handler, you may define what event occurs when users use rectangle, ellipse, lasso, or line tools. Users may use these various shapes to select objects and you, the developer, can decide what happens to the selected. For instance, in the <a href="https://github.com/VisDockHub/NewVisDock/blob/master/Tutorial.md">tutorial</a>, we show how to create clone elements to hightlight the selection.
